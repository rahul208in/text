Yes, your assumption is correct. The issue likely lies in the **metadata** being generated during the embedding process. If the metadata contains fields that are not consistently present in all JSON files or if the metadata values are of unsupported types (e.g., dictionaries, lists), it can cause problems during querying or embedding.

### **Proposed Solution**
To simplify and ensure consistency, you can use the **JSON file name** as the metadata. This will allow you to track the source of the data and avoid issues caused by missing or inconsistent fields in the metadata.

### **Updated Code for Metadata**

#### **`vector_store.py`**
Hereâ€™s the updated `embed_and_store_data` function:

```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
import json
import os

def embed_and_store_data(json_files, embeddings, persist_dir):
    """Embed and store data in ChromaDB."""
    vectorstore = Chroma(persist_directory=persist_dir, embedding_function=embeddings)

    for file_path in json_files:
        # Extract the file name to use as metadata
        file_name = os.path.basename(file_path)

        # Load the JSON file
        with open(file_path, "r") as f:
            file_data = json.load(f)

        # Check if the file contains vulnerabilities
        if isinstance(file_data, dict) and "vulnerabilities" in file_data:
            vulnerabilities = file_data["vulnerabilities"]

            # Ensure vulnerabilities is a list
            if isinstance(vulnerabilities, list):
                for item in vulnerabilities:
                    # Convert the JSON object to a string
                    text = json.dumps(item)

                    # Use the file name as metadata
                    metadata = {"source": file_name}

                    # Add text and metadata to the vectorstore
                    vectorstore.add_texts([text], metadatas=[metadata])
            else:
                print(f"Warning: 'vulnerabilities' is not a list in file {file_name}.")
        else:
            print(f"Warning: File {file_name} does not contain 'vulnerabilities' key or is not a dictionary.")

    return vectorstore
```

### **Explanation of Changes**
1. **Metadata Simplification**:
   - The metadata now only contains the `source` field, which is the name of the JSON file. This ensures consistency and avoids issues caused by missing or unsupported fields.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Added checks to ensure `vulnerabilities` is a list and the file contains the expected structure.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Added warnings to notify if a file does not contain the expected structure.

### **Query Process Update**
To include the source in the query response, update the `process_query` function to return the raw response along with the source.
