Great to hear that it's working! If the system is currently providing answers "as is" from the JSON, we can enhance it to make the responses more engaging, summarized, or tailored to your needs. Here are some expert suggestions to improve the system:

---

### **1. Summarize the Context Before Answering**
Instead of directly using the retrieved documents as context, you can summarize the retrieved documents before passing them to the LLM. This will:
- Reduce redundancy in the context.
- Allow the LLM to focus on the key points.
- Make the answers more concise and meaningful.

#### **Implementation**
You can use a summarization chain or a custom summarization prompt to summarize the retrieved documents before answering the question.

**Code Update:**
Modify the QA chain to include a summarization step for the retrieved documents.

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

def summarize_documents(llm, documents):
    """Summarize the retrieved documents."""
    summarization_prompt = PromptTemplate(
        template="Summarize the following text:\n\n{text}\n\nSummary:",
        input_variables=["text"]
    )
    summarization_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=summarization_prompt)

    # Combine all documents into one text and summarize
    combined_text = " ".join([doc.page_content for doc in documents])
    summary = summarization_chain.run({"text": combined_text})
    return summary
```

**Integration in `main.py`:**
Add the summarization step before passing the context to the QA chain.

```python
# Step 3: Interactive question answering
print("\nReady for questions!")
while True:
    question = input("\nEnter your question (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    if question.lower() == 'quit':
        break

    print("\nProcessing your question...")
    with suppress_stdout():
        result = qa_chain({"query": question})

    # Summarize the retrieved documents
    summary = summarize_documents(llm, result['source_documents'])

    # Use the summary as context for the final answer
    final_prompt = f"Use the following summary to answer the question:\n\n{summary}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:"
    final_answer = llm(final_prompt)

    print(f"\nQuestion: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {final_answer}")
    print("\nSource Documents:")
    for i, doc in enumerate(result['source_documents'], 1):
        print(f"\nDocument {i}:")
        print(doc.page_content[:200] + "..." if len(doc.page_content) > 200 else doc.page_content)
```

---

### **2. Rephrase Answers to Make Them More Engaging**
You can instruct the LLM to rephrase the answer in a more conversational or engaging tone. This can be done by modifying the prompt to include specific instructions.

#### **Implementation**
Update the QA chain's prompt to include rephrasing instructions.

**Updated Prompt:**
```python
strict_prompt = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
If you don't know the answer, just say "I don't know." Do not attempt to answer questions unrelated to the context.
Rephrase the answer to make it more engaging and conversational.

{context}

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
```

This will encourage the LLM to provide answers in a more interesting and conversational tone.

---

### **3. Generate Summarized and Contextualized Answers**
Instead of directly answering the question, you can ask the LLM to:
- Summarize the context.
- Provide a detailed, contextualized answer.

#### **Implementation**
Modify the prompt to include summarization and contextualization instructions.

**Updated Prompt:**
```python
strict_prompt = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
First, summarize the context in a few sentences. Then, provide a detailed and contextualized answer to the question.
If you don't know the answer, just say "I don't know." Do not attempt to answer questions unrelated to the context.

{context}

Question: {question}
Summary:
Answer:"""
```

This will make the answers more structured and informative.

---

### **4. Add a Creative or Expert Tone**
If you want the answers to sound more creative or expert-like, you can adjust the prompt to include specific instructions for tone and style.

#### **Implementation**
Modify the prompt to include tone/style instructions.

**Updated Prompt:**
```python
strict_prompt = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
Answer the question in a professional and expert tone. Provide additional insights or examples if relevant.
If you don't know the answer, just say "I don't know." Do not attempt to answer questions unrelated to the context.

{context}

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
```

This will make the answers sound more authoritative and insightful.

---

### **5. Use a Summarization Model**
If you want more advanced summarization, you can use a dedicated summarization model (e.g., `t5-small`, `bart-large-cnn`) to preprocess the documents before passing them to the LLM.

#### **Implementation**
Use a summarization model from `transformers` or `sentence-transformers`.

**Example:**
```python
from transformers import pipeline

def summarize_with_model(documents):
    """Summarize documents using a summarization model."""
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
    combined_text = " ".join([doc.page_content for doc in documents])
    summary = summarizer(combined_text, max_length=150, min_length=50, do_sample=False)
    return summary[0]['summary_text']
```

**Integration in `main.py`:**
Replace the `summarize_documents` function with `summarize_with_model`.

---

### **6. Add Follow-Up Questions**
To make the interaction more engaging, you can have the system suggest follow-up questions based on the context.

#### **Implementation**
Generate follow-up questions using the LLM.

**Example:**
```python
def generate_follow_up_questions(llm, context):
    """Generate follow-up questions based on the context."""
    follow_up_prompt = f"Based on the following context, suggest 3 follow-up questions:\n\n{context}\n\nQuestions:"
    follow_up_questions = llm(follow_up_prompt)
    return follow_up_questions
```

**Integration in `main.py`:**
After answering the question, generate and display follow-up questions.

```python
follow_up_questions = generate_follow_up_questions(llm, summary)
print("\nFollow-Up Questions:")
print(follow_up_questions)
```

---

### **7. Use a Chain of Thought (CoT) Approach**
Encourage the LLM to think step-by-step before answering. This can improve the quality of the answers.

#### **Implementation**
Modify the prompt to include step-by-step reasoning.

**Updated Prompt:**
```python
strict_prompt = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
Think step-by-step before answering. If you don't know the answer, just say "I don't know." Do not attempt to answer questions unrelated to the context.

{context}

Question: {question}
Step-by-step reasoning:
Answer:"""
```

---

### **8. Combine Summarization and Rephrasing**
You can combine summarization, rephrasing, and expert tone to create a highly engaging and informative system.

**Example Prompt:**
```python
strict_prompt = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
First, summarize the context in a few sentences. Then, provide a detailed and contextualized answer in a professional and engaging tone.
If you don't know the answer, just say "I don't know." Do not attempt to answer questions unrelated to the context.

{context}

Question: {question}
Summary:
Answer:"""
```

---

### **Recommendation**
- Start with **summarization** to reduce redundancy and improve focus.
- Add **rephrasing** or a specific tone to make the answers more engaging.
- If needed, use a **summarization model** for advanced preprocessing.
- Experiment with **follow-up questions** or **step-by-step reasoning** for a more interactive experience.
